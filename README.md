## Introduction
In this work, we tackle the problem of real-world fluid animation from a still image.  We propose a new and learnable representation, **surface-based layered representation(SLR)**, which decomposes the fluid and the static objects in the scene, to better synthesize the animated videos from a single fluid image. and design a **surface-only fluid simulation(SFS)** to model the evolution of the image fluids with better visual effects.

For more details of SLR-SFS, please refer to our paper and project page.


## ToDo list
- [ ] code of our reproduced Holynski's method(w/o motion estimation)
- [ ] code of SLR and pretrained model
- [ ] code of SFS
